# keep_seduced_units
This is a mod for **Total War: Warhammer III** allowing the seduced units by Slaneesh gimmick to be kept after the battle.

The mod is currently in beta phase (ready for use but not well tested).

Thanks for "Da Modding Den" community for the help they provide to modders of all levels, and for the documentation and tools they are maintaining.
